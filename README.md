# Dhan-Setu

**Dhan-Setu** is a 5-year financial life simulation game that builds real-world money habits through monthly decisions, realistic challenges, and delayed consequences.

Instead of teaching financial theory through quizzes, Dhan-Setu helps players experience how financial decisions impact their future. The game is designed for Students and Farmers and focuses on building financial resilience in real-life contexts.
